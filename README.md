This repository contains the official production files that can be used for laser cutting and 3D printing.

The folders contain:

* `production_files/`: Production files that you can use to manufacture the project with a laser cutter and 3D printer.
* `src/`: Source files that produced the production files. This project uses OpenSCAD as CAD. Hence, all dimensions can be adapted if required.

TODO: Add pictures of top down view prior to assembly.
